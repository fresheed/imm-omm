## Building the Project

### Requirements
* [Coq 8.9.1](https://coq.inria.fr)
* [Hahn library](https://github.com/vafeiadis/hahn) (`coq-hahn`)
* [The Coq development of A Promising Semantics for Relaxed-Memory Concurrency](https://github.com/snu-sf/promising-coq/tree/imm) (`coq-promising`)

### Building Manually

To build the project, one needs to install some libraries (`sflib`, `paco`, `promising-lib`, `promising-coq`, and `hahn`), which the project
depends on. This might be done by running `./configure`.
The command installs `Coq` as well. After that, one needs to run `make` (or `make -j4` for a faster build).

### Installation via OPAM
The project may be built and installed via OPAM:
```bash
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam remote add coq-promising-local -k git https://github.com/snu-sf/promising-opam-coq-archive
opam remote add coq-weakmemory-local -k git https://github.com/weakmemory/local-coq-opam-archive
opam install coq-imm
```

### Building in a virtual machine
Download the VirtualBox image from [here](http://plv.mpi-sws.org/imm/popl19-imm-artifact.ova) (or [here](http://podkopaev.net/popl19-imm-artifact)),
import it into VirtualBox, and boot the machine.
The image has been tested with VirtualBox 5.2.18 with Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension pack.

The login is `popl` and the password is `popl`.

All necessary software is installed, and the project is checked out to `/home/popl/imm`.
Additionally, Emacs and Proof General are installed so that you can browse the sources.

The proofs might be checked by opening a terminal and running
```bash
cd /home/popl/imm
make clean; make -j2
```
There might be some warnings about notations. The build terminating without printing "error" is successful.

### Building in a Docker container
First, one needs to build a Docker image with the project and its dependencies
```bash
sudo docker build -t weakmemory/imm .
```
or to pull it from Docker Hub
```bash
docker pull weakmemory/imm
```
After that, one has to connect to the container

```bash
docker run -it weakmemory/imm /bin/bash
```
and execute the following to update container's environment variables
and rebuild the project
```bash
eval `opam config env`
cd /imm
make clean; make -j4
```
